Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in csv, html and markdown?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your __HierarchyMap__, creates a __TenantSummary__ and builds granular __ScopeInsights__ on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group that you have read access on.

Challenges:

 * Holistic overview on governance implementation  
 * Connecting the dots

AzGovViz is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by connecting the dots.

### Required permissions in Azure

* RBAC permissions: __Reader__ role on Management Group level
* API permissions: If you run the script in the context of a Service Principal or in Azure Automation or on a Azure DevOps hosted agent (on top of the RBAC Role: _Reader_ on Management Group level) you will need to grant API permissions in Azure Active Directory (get-AzRoleAssignment cmdlet requirements). The Automation Account or Service Connection __App registration (Application)__ must be granted with: __Azure Active Directory API | Application | Directory | Read.All__ (admin consent required)

### Usage

#### PowerShell

* Requires PowerShell Az Modules
  * Az.Accounts
  * Az.Resources
  * Az.ResourceGraph
* Usage
  * `.\AzGovViz.ps1 -ManagementGroupId <your-Management-Group-Id>`
* Parameters
  * `-ManagementGroupId` Tenant Id or any child Management Group Id
  * `-CsvDelimiter` the world is split into two kind of delimiters - comma and semicolon - choose yours
  * `-OutputPath`
  * `-AzureDevOpsWikiAsCode`
  * `-DoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData` scrub user information
  * `-LimitCriticalPercentage` limit warning level, default is 80%
  * ~~`-HierarchyTreeOnly`~~ `-HierarchyMapOnly` output only the __HierarchyMap__ for Management Groups including linked Subscriptions
  * `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist` process only subscriptions with defined QuotaId(s)
  * `-NoResourceProvidersDetailed` disables output for ResourceProvider states for all Subscriptions in the __TenantSummary__ section, in large Tenants this can become time consuming
  * `-NoASCSecureScore` disables ASC Secure Score request for Subscriptions. The used API is in preview you may want to disable this
  * ~~`-UseAzureRM`~~ support for AzureRm modules has been deprecated
* Passed tests: Powershell Core on Windows
* Passed tests: Powershell 5.1.18362.752 on Windows
* Passed tests: Powershell Core on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

#### Azure DevOps Pipeline

The provided example Pipeline is configured to run based on a [schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers) (every 12 hours). It will push the AzGovViz markdown output file to the 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository which will feed your Wiki.

1. In Azure DevOps make sure to [enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=new-account-enabled) the Multistage Pipelines feature <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/multi-stage-pipelines-experience?view=azure-devops>
2. Clone the AzGovViz Repo
3. Create Pipeline, configure your pipeline selecting __Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file__, select the AzGovViz YAML from the AzGovViz (Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting) Repo
4. Grant Repository permissions: In order to allow the pipeline to push files back to our 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository the __Build Service__ Account ('%ProjectName% Build Service (%OrgName%)') must be granted with __Contribute__ permission  
![alt text](img/AzDO_Repo-Permissions.png "example output")
5. Run the Pipeline
6. Create Wiki by choosing [Publish Code as Wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser), define the folder 'wiki' from the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository as source

> Make sure your Service Connection has the required permissions (see [__Required permissions in Azure__](#required-permissions-in-azure)).

## AzGovViz sidenotes

### Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organizations best interest the __outputs should be protected from not authorized access!__

### Facts

Disabled Subscriptions and Subscriptions where Quota Id starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped (check parameter `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist`), all others are queried. More info on Quota Id / Offer numbers: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers" target="_blank">Supported Microsoft Azure offers</a> 
.  

ARM Limits are not acquired programmatically, they are hardcoded. The links used to check related Limits are commented in the param section of the script.

### Contributions

Please feel free to contribute. Thanks to so many supporters - testing, giving feedback, making suggestions, presenting use-case, posting/blogging articles, refactoring code - THANK YOU!

Thanks Stefan Stranger for providing me with his AzGovViz outputs executed on his implementation of EnterpriseScale. Make sure you read Stefan´s Blog Article: <a href="https://stefanstranger.github.io/2020/08/28/EnterpriseScalePolicyDrivenGovernance/" target="_blank">Enterprise-Scale - Policy Driven Governance</a>
